# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis Project
The Stack Overflow Developer Survey collected survey responses from thousands of developers who frequent the Stack Overflow website. In this analysis project, we seek to find out how gender has played a role in the industry today. Do wage disparities exist between genders? Does one gender report higher satisfaction ratings with their job? By visualizing and interpreting the data collected from the survey, we hope to answer these questions.
